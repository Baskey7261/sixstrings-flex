                        The grading system begins at grade initial for beginners and continues through to grade 8. Every pupil at Musical Six Strings will undergo an initial assessment to determine their current grade level in accordance with, the Trinity College of London (TCL)
                        syllabus.

                        Grades 6-8 are a minimum requirement for students hoping to be put forward for further education such as a diploma or higher. We encourage our pupils to work toward completing each grade, however, we do also cater to pupils that are just aiming to hone
                        their current skills and expand on their musical repertoire.
